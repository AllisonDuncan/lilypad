GOALS

1. User needs to do chores
    * what chores are available?
    * how much are they worth?
    * what chores has the user claimed/selected?
2. User earns stars by completing chores
    * how many stars for the chore?
    * process will need to be worked through on this point.
3. User saves stars in the starbank
    * how many stars does the user have?
    * star change history?
4. User spends stars in the store
    * what products are available in the store
    * how much do they cost?
    * add products to cart before purchase
    * 
5. Admin manages chores
6. Admin manages store inventory
7. Admin approves chore completion before stars are issued
8. Admin process to remove stars without store order (custom transaction/order)
** future idea: have some reoccuring items such as subscriptions from the store and frequently used chores
